These stickers should be delivered within 24 hours to maximize freshness and ensure optimal visibility during the promotional period.\n\nCould you please confirm if there is any stock available or if we need to expedite shipping? Also, could we specify which region(s) we would like the stickers shipped to so that we can better allocate resources?\n\nThank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.
